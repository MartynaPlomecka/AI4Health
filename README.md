In the multi-label classification, the training set (power spectra) is composed of instances each associated with a set of labels: <br />
(7 different diagnoses: <br />
 'Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder',
 'Anxiety Disorders',
 'Specific Learning Disorder',
 'Autism Spectrum Disorder',
 'Disruptive, 
 'Communication Disorder',
 'Depressive Disorders'), <br />
 and the task is to predict the label sets of unseen instances through analyzing training instances with known label sets.

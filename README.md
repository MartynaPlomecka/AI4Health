In the multi-label classification, the training set (power spectra) is composed of instances each associated with a set of labels (7 different diagnoses - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder',
 'Anxiety Disorders',
 'Specific Learning Disorder',
 'Autism Spectrum Disorder',
 'Disruptive, 
 'Communication Disorder',
 'Depressive Disorders'), and the task is to predict the label sets of unseen instances through analyzing training instances with known label sets.
